# Welcome to QuintinDk’s Homepage

I'm a proud father to a beautiful daughter (who thankfully takes after her mom), but when I'm not busy dad-ing, I'm a tech whiz with over 24 years of experience in all sorts of wild and wacky technologies. Think of me like a superhero, but instead of fighting crime, I'm putting together the building blocks of tech solutions to make sure my customers get the best outcome possible.

I'm crazy passionate about all things tech. Agile, DevOps, Cloud, Open Source, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, Architecture, Software Development - you name it, I'm into it. I'm basically a tech junkie who's always on the lookout for the latest and greatest. And when it comes to open-source technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Spark, Cassandra, Redis, and MySQL, I'm like a kid in a candy store. But don't worry, I'm not a one-trick pony. I've also got mad skills in Microsoft tech like .NET, SQL Server, and Azure.

So yeah, that's me in a nutshell - a dad by day, a tech ninja by night.

## 📃 Azure certs

3 weeks ago I undertook a little challenge for myself; get the Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert and the Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert in as little time as possible. I didn't have an end date in mind since it meant I'd have to write 4 exams. Today I finished this challenge, wrote 5 exams in 3 weeks an obtained 5 different certifications:

1. [Microsoft Certified: Azure Developer Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/335f844b-adf0-4734-94c7-dafb7697586a/public_url)
2. [Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/28833d99-2fe5-4da3-8962-672b36dbe9cf/public_url)\
3. Microsoft Certified: Azure Network Engineer Associate
4. [Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert](https://www.credly.com/badges/20f4f669-2ac9-4f04-b3a7-d95a86087e82/public_url)
5. [Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert](https://www.credly.com/badges/1c09766c-8f31-40fd-84e2-e75969b888b9/public_url)

I also renewed my [Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate](https://www.credly.com/badges/0954eea6-7f77-4b25-9aa0-6c47ee0ea6d3/public_url).

So, what's next 😎.

## 🎯 Azure Percona

Recently, working on a MySQL implementation in Azure, I was not happy with the [Azure MySQL Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/flexible-server/overview) implementation from Azure itself and decided to go with MySQL VM instances instead. Of course, this was not the best decision and caused some crazy technical debt which we had to address such as automated backups, performance and management etc. So, I decided that the Percona set of tools for backups, management and monitoring would be a handy product in Azure Market place and I needed something to do.

## 🌟 Azure Resource Inventory

[Azure Resource Inventory](https://github.com/microsoft/ARI) PowerShell 🤮 script is extremely powerful and has very handy feature to draw the resources in a [draw.io](https://draw.io) diagram. Most other automated diagraming implementations suck but this one is pretty cool 😎.

  Today I created my first PR for a public project 😁. I'm super excited and anxious for what they'll do with it. It was on the [Azure Resource Inventory](https://github.com/microsoft/ARI) project. This PowerShell 🤮 script is extremely powerful and has very handy feature to draw the resources in a [draw.io](https://draw.io) diagram. Most other automated diagraming implementations suck but this one is pretty cool 😎.
  <br>
  Anyway, I ran the script as soon as I got access to the customers Azure subscription aut it didn't produce the diagram no mater what I tried 😢. So I switched to windows, because I know it worked there, and completed the demo.
  <br>
  This morning I got back to the office, opened vs code and it opened the script right on the line I needed to change. I made the changes, tested it and then pushed to my fork and then created the PR.

2022-12-12 - My PR was approved... I'm happy to announce that my PR was accepted and merged. I'm an open source contributor now 😊🙌.

Well, that's my TIL for today. Keep cool and stay positive.
