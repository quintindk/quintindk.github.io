## Azure Percona

Recently, working on a MySQL implementation in Azure, I was not happy with the [Azure MySQL Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/flexible-server/overview) implementation from Azure itself and decided to go with MySQL VM instances instead. Of course, this was not the best decision and caused some crazy technical debt which we had to address such as automated backups, performance and management etc. So, I decided that the Percona set of tools for backups, management and monitoring would be a handy product in Azure Market place and I needed something to do.

## Azure Resource Inventory

Today I created my first PR for a public project üòÅ. I'm super excited and anxious for what they'll do with it. It was on the [Azure Resource Inventory](https://github.com/microsoft/ARI) project. This PowerShell ü§Æ script is extremely powerful and has very handy feature to draw the resources in a [draw.io](https://draw.io) diagram. Most other automated diagraming implementations suck but this one is pretty cool üòé.

Anyway, I ran the script as soon as I got access to the customers Azure subscription aut it didn't produce the diagram no mater what I tried üò¢. So I switched to windows, because I know it worked there, and completed the demo.

This morning I got back to the office, opened vs code and it opened the script right on the line I needed to change. I made the changes, tested it and then pushed to my fork and then created the PR.

Well, that's my TIL for today. Keep cool and stay positive.
